#Features
- Slider on main screen controls search radius
- Search button finds all coffee shops within the search radius and displays them in a list
- The checkbox in each list item is used to store if a place has been visited by the user before or not (it's up to the user to update this for their own record keeping)
- Tapping on a list item will cause a google map to open, showing the location of the store with a pin, and the location of the user with a blue dot. (hitting the phone's physical back button will bring you back to the search screen)
